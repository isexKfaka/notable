- Check your email confirmation. If you bought the software online from Entrust or an authorized reseller, you should have received an email confirmation with your serial number and other details.
- Check your USB security key. If you received a physical USB security key with your software package, you can find your serial number on a sticker attached to the key.
- Check your DVD case. If you received a DVD with your software package, you can find your serial number on a sticker inside the case.
- Check your software interface. If you have already installed and activated the software, you can find your serial number in the software interface. To do this, open the ID Works Administrator module and click on Help > About ID Works.

If none of these methods work for you, or if you have lost or misplaced your serial number, you can contact Entrust support for assistance. You will need to provide proof of purchase and some information about your software installation.
 
Finding your ID Works 6.5 serial number is important for maintaining and managing your identification software. Keep it in a safe place and do not share it with anyone else.
