Lighting effects can add drama, realism, and mood to your images. They can also help you highlight certain areas, create shadows, and simulate different light sources. Photoshop CS4 Ultra Light Edition by Gamolama has a dedicated Lighting Effects filter that lets you produce various lighting effects on your images. You can also use textures from grayscale files (called bump maps) to produce 3D-like effects and save your own styles for use in other images[^1^].
 
## Step 1: Open the Lighting Effects Filter
 
To apply the Lighting Effects filter, you need to have an 8-bit RGB image in Photoshop. You also need to have a supported video card to use this filter. For more information, see this FAQ[^1^].
 
Once you have your image ready, choose Filter > Render > Lighting Effects. This will open the Lighting Effects dialog box, where you can see a preview window and a Properties panel.
 
## Step 2: Choose a Preset or Create Your Own
 
In the Properties panel, you can choose from several presets that are already available for different lighting effects. You can also create your own custom preset by choosing Custom from the Preset menu and clicking the Lights icons to add Point, Spot, and Infinite types of lights. You can add up to 16 lights in one preset[^1^].
 
To save your custom preset, click Save, name the style, and click OK. You can then access it from the Preset menu in the future.
 
## Step 3: Adjust Individual Lights and Global Settings
 
In the preview window, you can select individual lights that you want to adjust. You can drag them anywhere on the canvas, change their color, intensity, and hotspot size. You can also choose a light type (Spot, Infinite, or Point) from the top menu in the Properties panel[^1^].

Infinite lights shine light across an entire plane, like the sun.
 
Point lights shine light in all directions from directly above the image, like a light bulb.
 
In the lower half of the Properties panel, you can adjust the global settings for the entire set of lights. You can colorize the overall lighting, control the exposure, gloss, metallic, ambience, and texture of the image[^1^].
 
## Step 4: Apply the Filter and Enjoy Your Results
 
When you are happy with your lighting effects, click OK to apply the filter to your image. You can then save your image or make further adjustments as needed.
